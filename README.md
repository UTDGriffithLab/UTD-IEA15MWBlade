# UTD IEA 15 MW Blade Model
<img align="right" width="300" src="Picture/utd_iea15mwblade_pic.png">

- The UTD IEA 15 MW blade model created by [Dr. D. Todd Griffith's group](https://labs.utdallas.edu/griffith/) is contained in this repository. 
- The UTD IEA 15 MW blade model was created using the modeling tool [NuMAD v2.0](https://github.com/sandialabs/NuMAD/releases/tag/v2.0) based on the original open-source [IEA 15 MW reference wind turbine blade design](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy20osti/75698.pdf). The UTD IEA 15 MW blade model was created to increase the body of knowledge on large-scale wind turbines and provide one more resource to the wind energy community that can be used as reference for future studies. 
- Detailed documentation of the blade structure and baseline structural performance of UTD IEA 15 MW blade model will be presented at the AIAA SciTech 2023 conference. The paper will be added in this repo as soon as it is made available, please see the Citation section below for the appropriate citation for this work. 

# Repo Contents
The following summarizes the contents in this repo:
- NuMAD model: 
   - NuMAD_utd_iea15mw.xlsx : Primary input file for NuMAD v2.0. Spreadsheet that contains the blade model data (detailed geometry, materials, layup information, and bill of materials summary). 
   - utd_iea15mw.nmd : NuMAD model file using NuMAD v2.0 with input from the NuMAD_utd_iea15ms.xlsx spreadsheet. 
   - MatDBsi.txt : NuMAD materials database containing the material and laminate property information. 
   - "airfoils" folder : Contains set of files with the NuMAD airfoil geometry coordinates used to model the blade. 
- Useful output files: 
  - shell7.src : ANSYS input file generated by NuMAD to create a finite element model of the blade. 
  - utd_iea15mw.p3d : Blade external geometry file in Plot 3D file format. 
  - utd_iea15mw.iges : Blade external geometry exported from ANSYS for CAD modeling. Contains surfaces of the outer moldline of the blade and shear webs. 
  - utd_iea15mw_ElastoDynBlade_ratedrpm.dat: OpenFAST ElastoDyn blade file with mode shapes at rated rpm. 
- Additional outputs from PreComp and BModes: 
  - PreComp_SectionData.mat : Output MATLAB structure that contains a full set of cross-sectional blade properties generated by PreComp. 
  - bmodes_0rpm.out : BModes output file that contains the blade frequencies and mode shapes for parked conditions (0 rpm).
