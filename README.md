# UTD IEA 15 MW Blade Model

- The UTD IEA 15 MW blade model created by [Dr. D. Todd Griffith's group](https://labs.utdallas.edu/griffith/) is contained in this repository. 
- The UTD IEA 15 MW blade model was created using the modeling tool [NuMAD v2.0](https://github.com/sandialabs/NuMAD/releases/tag/v2.0) based on the original open-source [IEA 15 MW reference wind turbine blade design](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy20osti/75698.pdf). The UTD IEA 15 MW blade model was created to increase the body of knowledge on large-scale wind turbines and provide one more resource to the wind energy community that can be used as reference for future studies. 
- Detailed documentation of the blade structure and baseline structural performance of UTD IEA 15 MW blade model will be presented at the AIAA SciTech 2023 conference. The reference for the paper is provided below and the paper will be added in this repo as soon as it is available.
